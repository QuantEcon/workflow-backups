# Configuration Example for QuantEcon Repository Backup Workflow

# Copy this file to config.yml and update with your settings.
# Never commit config.yml with real credentials!

# Backup configuration
backup:
  # Enable or disable backup task
  enabled: true
  
  # GitHub organization to backup
  organization: "quantecon"
  
  # Skip archived repositories (default: false)
  # Archived repos are read-only and typically don't need frequent backups
  exclude_archived: true
  
  # Exact repository names (no regex needed)
  # Use this for specific repos - cleaner than regex for individual repos
  repositories:
    - "my-important-repo"
    - "QuantEcon.manual"        # Dots and special chars work as-is
  
  # Repository name patterns (Python regex)
  # Use this for matching multiple repos with patterns
  patterns:
    - "lecture-.*"              # Matches: lecture-python.myst, lecture-julia, etc.
    - "quantecon-.*"            # Matches: quantecon-notebooks-python, etc.
  
  # Exclude specific repositories by exact name
  # These repos will be skipped even if they match patterns above
  exclude_repositories:
    - "testing-repo"
    - "codespaces-test"
  
  # Exclude repositories matching patterns (Python regex)
  # Applied after include matching - excludes take priority
  exclude_patterns:
    - ".*-test$"                # Exclude repos ending in -test
    - "test-.*"                 # Exclude repos starting with test-
  
  # Metadata backup configuration
  # WARNING: Issues backup requires many API calls (1 per issue for comments)
  # See: https://github.com/QuantEcon/workflow-backups/issues/3
  backup_metadata:
    issues: false               # Export issues with comments (disabled by default)
    # releases: false           # Export releases (future feature)
  
  # AWS S3 configuration

    region: "us-east-1"
    
    # Prefix for all backup objects in the bucket
    # Backups will be stored as: s3://{bucket}/{prefix}/{repo-name}/{repo-name}-{date}.tar.gz
